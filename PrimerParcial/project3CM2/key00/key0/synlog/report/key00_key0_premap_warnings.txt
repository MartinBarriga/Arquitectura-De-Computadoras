@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT531 :"c:\users\martin\desktop\arqui3cm2\primerparcial\project3cm2\key00\coder00.vhdl":20:2:20:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 8 sequential elements including K02.outcoderc[6].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\martin\desktop\arqui3cm2\primerparcial\project3cm2\div00vhdl\div00.vhdl":20:2:20:3|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 23 sequential elements including K00.D01.sdiv[21:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
